## LaTeXed lecture notes for the MSRI Floer Homotopy Introductory Workshop
You can access my notes [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H7JFCFQh6zq9RzmirOgFPbyRiYLCvx8v/view).

The lectures on free loop spaces and the Floer homology foundation lectures are missing: I will type them out during January, 2023.
